## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project was built using only fundamental web technologies, with no complex frameworks or build tools required.

*   **HTML5:** For the core structure and content of the website. Semantic HTML tags were used for better accessibility and SEO.
*   **Tailwind CSS (via CDN):** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building a custom, responsive design without writing custom CSS. Dark mode is implemented using Tailwind's `dark:` variant.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the interactivity and dynamic content generation. Key JS features used include:
    *   DOM Manipulation (creating elements, adding/removing classes)
    *   Event Listeners (`click`, `scroll`)
    *   Array Methods (`forEach`, `map`, `new Set`)
    *   `localStorage` for saving the theme preference
    *   Asynchronous functions like `setTimeout` for animations.

## üîß How to Customize

This project is designed to be easily customized.

### Adding or Changing Projects

The portfolio is data-driven, which makes it incredibly simple to update.

1.  Open the `app.js` file.
2.  Find the `portfolioData` array near the top of the file.
3.  To add a new project, simply add a new object to the array:

    ```javascript
    const portfolioData = [
        // ... existing projects
        { category: 'web', imgSrc: 'path/to/your/new-image.jpg', alt: 'Description of New Project' },
    ];
    ```

4.  To change a project, just edit the `category`, `imgSrc`, or `alt` text of an existing object. The website will update automatically.

### Changing the "Typing" Text

1.  Open the `app.js` file.
2.  Locate the `textToType` constant within the "TYPING EFFECT" section.
3.  Change the string to whatever you want your title to be.

    ```javascript
    const textToType = "Your New Awesome Title";
    ```
